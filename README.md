# Obesity-Level
Machine Learning Project to predict Obesity Level based on eating habits and physical conditions.

In recent years, obesity has become one of the most significant public health challenges around the world. With the increase in sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary habits, the number of individuals at risk for obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes, heart diseases, and hypertension keep rising. This project leverages machine learning models to predict obesity levels based on individuals’ eating habits and physical conditions using a synthetic dataset derived from real-world patterns.
The business problem we aim to address is the early identification of obesity risk based on behavioral and physiological inputs. Early detection can enable healthcare providers, nutritionists, and policymakers to design timely and personalized interventions. An accurate predictive model can support decision-making in health promotion campaigns, personalized diet planning, and preventative medicine strategies.

Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this project is titled “Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition” and was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes real and synthetically generated data for 2,111 individuals, with a balanced representation across various obesity levels.

Objective:
The primary objective is to build a predictive classification model that can accurately estimate an individual’s obesity level (e.g., Underweight, Normal Weight, Obese Type I, etc.) using features such as physical activity, eating habits, and body metrics.

Target Variable:
The target variable for this classification problem is NObeyesdad, which categorizes an individual’s obesity level into one of several classes (e.g., Insufficient_Weight, Normal_Weight, Obesity_Type_I, etc.).
